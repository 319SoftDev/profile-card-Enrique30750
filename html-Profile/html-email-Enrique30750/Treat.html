    Fear not the spooky night, </p>                      
Remember, magic feels just right. </p>
Every ghost and goblin's dance, </p>
Eerie winds put you in a trance. </p>
Frightening sights are sneak like a mice, </p>
A mysterious glow in the air. </p>
Shadows flicker, secrets unfold, </p>
Happiness is the story untold. </p>
In every scare, a thrill so grand, </p>
Only brave hearts understand. </p>
Night falls softly on this Halloween, </p>
Daring souls are truly seen.</p>
Only dark night falls</p>
Luminous spirits, shining bright, </p>
Let The breeze make you sneeze </p>
All around, a haunted night. </p>
Remember fears, but also cheer, </p>
Spooky fun is drawing near!</p>
➕So give your candy to room —</p>

<p>I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
he did the monster mash
(The monster mash) it was a graveyard smash
(He did the mash) it caught on in a flash
(He did the mash) he did the monster mash
from my laboratory in the castle east
(Wa-ooh) to the master bedroom where the vampires feast
(Wa-wa-ooh) the ghouls all came from their humble abodes
(Wa-ooh) to get a jolt from my electrodes
they did the monster mash
(The monster mash) it was a graveyard smash
(They did the mash) it caught on in a flash
(They did the mash) they did the monster mash
the zombies were having fun
(Ta-da-shoop, wa-ooh) the party had just begun
(Ta-da-shoop, wa-ooh) the guests included Wolfman
(Ta-da-shoop, wa-ooh) Dracula, and his son
the scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
(Wa-ooh) Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
(Wa-wa-ooh) the coffin-bangers were about to arrive
(Wa-ooh) with their vocal group, The Crypt-Kicker Five
, they played the monster mash
(The monster mash) it was a graveyard smash
(They played the mash) it caught on in a flash
(They played the mash) they played the monster mash
out from his coffin', Drac's voice did ring
(Wa-ooh) seems he was troubled by just one thing
(Wa-wa-ooh) he opened the lid and shook his fist and said
(Wa-ooh) "Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?"
it's now the monster mash
(The monster mash) and it's a graveyard smash
(It's now the mash) it's caught on in a flash
(It's now the mash) it's now the monster mash
now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
(Wa-ooh) and my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
(Wa-wa-ooh) for you, the living, this mash was meant too
(Wa-ooh) when you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you
then you can monster mash
(The monster mash) and do my graveyard smash
(Then you can mash) you'll catch on in a flash
(Then you can mash) then you can monster mash
mash good
(Monster mash, wa-ooh) easy, Igor, you impetuous young boy
(Monster mash, wa-ooh) mash good
(Monster mash, wa-ooh)
(Monster mash, wa-ooh)
(Monster mash, wa-ooh)
(Monster mash, wa-ooh)
(Monster mash, wa-ooh)</p>

<p>If there's somethin' strange in your neighborhood
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
If there's somethin' weird, and it don't look good
Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)


I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost


If you're seein' things runnin' through your head
Who can you call? (Ghostbusters!)
An invisible man sleepin' in your bed
Oh, who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)


I ain't afraid of no ghost
Uh, I ain't afraid of no ghost


Who you gon' call? (Ghostbusters!)
