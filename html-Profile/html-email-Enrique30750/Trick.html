<p>Stewie: It's Halloween, as we prepare
A nightmare that's beyond compare.
As freaks and goblins creepily advance,
Brian: There's really only one sure way
To keep those ghosts and ghouls at bay.
Stewie: It's Stewie's Spooky Quahog Nightmare Dance.
Stick out your arms like Frankenstein
And swing your booty just like mine
Or like Shakira in her sexy pants.
Brian: Let your head bob up and down
Like that weird kid from Charlie Brown
And twist your body like you're in a trance.
Stewie: And when those spirits start to rise,
You'll quickly cut them down to size
With Stewie's Spooky Quahog Nightmare Dance!
Lois is a rotting corpse fresh from the bowels of hell.
Peter is a toxic zombie with a noxious smell.
Chris has mutant creatures bursting from each arm and leg.
Brian: And Meg...!
Stewie: Well, oh my god, we've done it now.
Meg really is a witch somehow.
Her face is scowling just like Steve Van Zandt's.
She's really on a tear up there,
But we're all fine and safe down here with Stewie's Spooky.
Kinda crazy, kinda cooky...
Brian and Stewie: Stewie's Spooky Quahog Nightmare Dance!!</p>
